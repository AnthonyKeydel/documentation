## Overview

The API Catalog Explorer page shows all endpoints in all environments in your Datadog organizations. At a quick glance, you can see APIs and the accountable teams you can work with to improve reliability. This page provides some sample use cases for using the API Catalog Explorer.

API monitoring is the process of gathering, visualizing, and alerting on pre-defined metrics in order to ensure that an API is meeting specific expectations, and access to context-rich data that enables to debug unanticipated API issues once they occur
